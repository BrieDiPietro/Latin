3.11

a participle can be a compact clause

- nt: present active
- t or s: perfect passive
- ur: future active

*when you see a participle*
- Attributive: used as just a plain adjective
- Predicative: adds another clause including a verb thing
  can it be a clause?
    - temporal
    - causal
    - concessive
    - conditional

---

**Ablative Absolute**
a participle all by itself
creating a clause alone
separated
adverbial
use a participle to create a subordinate clause that isn't connected to the main clause
- uses 2 words: put the subject and the participle in the ablative and make them agree

*steps to deal with them*
- see a couple ablatives that don't have some real reason to be ablative
- one of the words will be a participle
- figure out the subject
- what is it trying to say (time, cause, concession, condition)

*some clarification*
- doesn't have to be just 2 words
- verb can have objects etc
- nouns can have adjectives etc
