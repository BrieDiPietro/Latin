**Passive Voice Review**

subject receives the action

Active: Subject -> Verb -> Object
Passive: Subject <- Verb <- (ablative)

using ablative:
person: ā + ablative
thing: ablative

2 ways to make it
- 4th pp + sum
- weird personal endings

      r     mur
      ris   minī
      tur   ntur

4th pp:
ends w/ t or s and then us, a, um

**Worksheet Practice**

**U-Declension**
mostly masculine
marked by "u" in ending

      us  ūs
      ūs  uum
      uī  ibus
      um  ūs
      ū   ibus

**E-Declension**
littlest declension
almost all feminine

      ēs  ēs
      eī  ērum
      eī  ēbus
      em  ēs
      ē   ēbus
