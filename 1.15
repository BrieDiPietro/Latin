Passive Voice

Latin does this in 2 ways

**Present System**
Stay on 2nd principal parts
Change personal endings
  o mus    r   mur
  s tis    ris minī
  t nt     tur ntur

**Perfect System**
Change of principal parts: move to the 4th PP
Always 2 parts, use a form of sum that matches the subject
the "participle" (the 4th pp) acts as an adjective (matches in gender and number)


**Ablative**
The ablative is used to do the "by ___"
if it's a person, ā +person in ablative
if it's a thing, just thing in ablative
